**Key Insights:**
- Try to follow the purchase priority and strategy priority as close as possible.
- Use your judgment, sometimes a different priority is better, but most times the priority will be the best strategy.
- Build up your economy early with Oxygen, Carbon and Impose Tariffs. Next buy a few Precision Strikes when possible
- Buy extra action cards mid game (round 9+) to get more damage after you have a few Precision Strikes/Critical Hits. Specifically Preemptive Intelligence, but Counter Espionage can be useful to slow your opponent down.
- Sometimes you should buy cards worth less than what you have available to spend. Sometimes buying Preemptive Intelligence with 500 credits to spend is ok if the priority order demands it.
- Take advantage of extra action. Always use them when you can.
- Pay attention to what your opponenet is doing. If they buy damage card be sure you are buying them too. If you can't then buy defensive cards to match
- When you have lower health and you draw a bad hand, always make use of the Hydrogen cards to redraw cards to try to get better cards. This catch up mechanic can save you from losing!
