# GALACTIC CONFRONTATION - OPTIMAL STRATEGY GUIDE

## CRITICAL RULE #1: ALWAYS BUY CRITICAL HIT
**If you can afford Critical Hit (800 credits), you MUST buy it. No exceptions.**
- Critical Hit is the win condition of this game
- Never buy anything else if you have 800+ credits and Critical Hit is available
- This rule overrides all other priorities

## PURCHASE DECISION TREE

Use this exact decision tree for EVERY buy phase:

### Step 1: Check Critical Hit
- **IF** you have 800+ credits AND Critical Hit is available → **BUY IT**
- **ELSE** proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: What round is it?

#### ROUNDS 0-5 (Early Game - Build Economy)
Purchase priority:
1. **Impose Tariffs** (500 credits) - Buy 2 copies total
2. **Carbon** (600 credits) - Buy 2 copies total  
3. **Oxygen** (300 credits) - Buy 2-3 copies maximum, NEVER MORE
4. **Counter Espionage** (300 credits) - Only if ahead on damage

**DO NOT BUY:**
- Aggressive Acquisition (waste of credits)
- More than 3 Oxygen (diminishing returns)
- Hydrogen (free cards are bad)

#### ROUNDS 6-8 (Mid Game - First Damage Cards)
Purchase priority:
1. **Critical Hit** (800 credits) - Already checked in Step 1, but reminder: ALWAYS BUY
2. **Precision Strike** (600 credits) - Buy 2-3 copies
3. **Carbon** (600 credits) - If you still need economy
4. **Impose Tariffs** (500 credits) - If you don't have 2 yet

#### ROUNDS 9+ (Late Game - Damage Amplification)
Purchase priority:
1. **Critical Hit** (800 credits) - Buy every copy you can
2. **Preemptive Intelligence** (300 credits) - Buy 2-4 copies for action economy
3. **Precision Strike** (600 credits) - Buy up to 4 copies total
4. **Counter Espionage** (300 credits) - If opponent has many damage cards
5. **Defensive Maneuver** (300 credits) - Only if you're behind on HP

### Step 3: Can't afford anything good?
- **IF** you have 0-200 credits → End buy phase, don't waste resources
- **IF** you have 300+ credits but nothing good available → Buy Preemptive Intelligence or Defensive Maneuver

## STRATEGY PHASE DECISION TREE

**Always play cards in this exact order:**

### Priority 1: Action Generators (Play These First)
1. **Preemptive Intelligence** - Gives +2 actions and draws a card
2. **Impose Tariffs** - Draws card, gives credits, gives buy (only play in strategy phase if it helps you play more cards)
3. **Counter Espionage** - Gives +2 actions

### Priority 2: Damage Cards (Play After Actions)
4. **Defensive Maneuver** - If you're about to take lethal damage
5. **Critical Hit** - Always play if you have actions remaining
6. **Precision Strike** - Play if you have actions remaining

### Priority 3: Economy Cards (Only if They Enable More Actions)
7. **Aggressive Acquisition** - Only if you have it (you shouldn't)
8. **Trade Negotiations** - Don't play in strategy phase, save for buy phase

**CRITICAL: If you have multiple damage cards but only 1 action remaining, save your action for Critical Hit over Precision Strike (3 damage > 1 damage)**

## CLEANUP PHASE - TRASHING PRIORITY

When you have trash abilities available, trash in this order:
1. **Impeded** (completely useless cards)
2. **Hydrogen** (weak economy)
3. **Extra Oxygen** (if you have 4+ copies)
4. **Trade Negotiations** (after Round 8, it's not worth the deck space)

**Goal:** Keep your deck lean (15-20 cards) for consistency

## SPECIAL RULES

### Hydrogen Redraw Ability
**IF** you have less health than opponent AND you draw a bad hand (no damage cards, no action cards):
- Discard ALL Hydrogen cards in hand
- Redraw that many cards
- This is your catch-up mechanic - use it aggressively when behind

### When to Play vs When to Save
**Play immediately:**
- Preemptive Intelligence (gets you more cards/actions)
- Critical Hit (deals damage)
- Precision Strike (deals damage)

**Consider saving for next turn:**
- Never save damage cards if you can play them now
- You might not draw them again for several turns

## QUICK REFERENCE: CARD VALUES

**S-Tier (Always Buy):**
- Critical Hit (800) - Win condition

**A-Tier (Core Strategy):**
- Impose Tariffs (500) - Acceleration engine
- Carbon (600) - Strong economy
- Preemptive Intelligence (300) - Action economy

**B-Tier (Situational):**
- Precision Strike (600) - Solid damage + trash
- Oxygen (300) - Early economy only
- Counter Espionage (300) - If ahead
- Defensive Maneuver (300) - If behind

**F-Tier (Never Buy):**
- Aggressive Acquisition (300) - Waste of credits
- Hydrogen (0) - Dilutes deck
- Braintrust Accumulation (400) - Inefficient

## WINNING FORMULA

**Early Game (Rounds 0-5):**
- Buy: 2-3 Oxygen, 2 Carbon, 2 Impose Tariffs
- Goal: Get to 800 credits per turn consistently

**Mid Game (Rounds 6-9):**
- Buy: 2-3 Critical Hits, 2 Precision Strikes
- Goal: Start dealing damage

**Late Game (Rounds 10+):**
- Buy: 2-4 Preemptive Intelligence, more Critical Hits
- Goal: Play 2-3 damage cards per turn for 4-9 damage
- Trash Hydrogen/Impeded aggressively

**Victory Condition:**
- 3+ Critical Hits + 2+ Preemptive Intelligence = 9 damage per turn
- Opponent dead in 2-3 turns
