## The Game
This is a two player strategy deck building game. Players channel spirit energy to access technique cards and build a deck that can defeat their opponent.

The goal of the game is to reduce your opponent's stamina to 0. The game is played over several rounds where each player takes a turn. Each round has two phases. First is the player phase where each player takes a turn. Then there is a strike resolution phase where damage is dealt.

## Setup

Separate all the different cards into individual piles so that all the cards of the same name are in their own piles. There are 10 cards of each kind. This is called the Available Techniques. Then each player builds a starting deck with 7 Focus cards and 3 Misstep cards and shuffles them. Players then each draw 5 cards into their hand. Each player starts with 10 stamina.

## How to Play
A player's turn has multiple phases. They are as follows:
1. Technique
2. Channel
3. Cleanup

The Technique Phase is where the player may play technique cards from their hand. By default the player can play one technique card. However, the card may allow them to increase the number of technique cards they can play. It may also give other bonuses. Once a card is played it is placed in the player's discard pile unless it is a damage or defense card. When playing a technique card its effect is immediately applied and effects can stack so think carefully about the sequence of cards you will play. Some technique cards allow you to draw more cards which can be useful to play more cards or gain more spirit.

The Channel Phase is where the player may use resource cards to pay for additional cards from the Available Techniques. Each card has a price and the player can combine resources to add up to the price of the card. There is no change after a card is channeled. If there is a situation where the player must spend more resource cards than they need to channel a card the extra is lost. Once a card is channeled the player may put that card in their discard pile. They also put all resource cards used for the channel into the discard pile as well. By default the player may only channel one card during their Channel Phase, however there are technique cards which may increase the number of cards a player can channel. There are also technique cards that increase the amount of spirit the player has available during the Channel Phase. This spirit can only be used during the subsequent Channel Phase that the technique card was played. Once the Channel Phase ends the additional spirit is lost if it is not spent.

The Cleanup Phase is at the end of the player's turn. Some technique cards allow the player to refine a number of cards. The player may refine cards at this time. To refine a card simply remove it from the game. At this point they will discard any cards left in their hand. Then draw a new set of 5 cards from their deck. If they are unable to draw more cards because the deck has run out they first draw the cards that are left and then they must shuffle their discard pile and this becomes their new deck where they then draw the remaining cards.

After both players have finished their turn the strike resolution phase of the round begins. During this phase players count up damage and defense from technique cards they played during their Technique Phase. Defense cards reduce the damage an opponent has done. Both players calculate damage simultaneously and reduce their stamina. If a player has 0 or less stamina they have been defeated and their opponent wins! If both have been reduced to 0 or less at the same time then the game ends in a tie. If neither has been reduced to 0 all damage and defense cards are discarded and the next round begins.

## Misstep Cards
Misstep cards have no use in the game. They represent errors in form and technique that fighters make during combat. They cannot be played or discarded during the Technique or Channel Phase. They can only be refined or discarded during the Cleanup Phase.
