# GALACTIC CONFRONTATION - OPTIMAL STRATEGY GUIDE v3.0

## CRITICAL RULE #1: ALWAYS BUY CRITICAL HIT
**If you can afford Critical Hit (800 credits), you MUST buy it. No exceptions.**
- Critical Hit is the win condition of this game
- Never buy anything else if you have 800+ credits and Critical Hit is available
- This rule overrides all other priorities

## CRITICAL RULE #2: DEFENSE WHEN BEHIND ON HP
**NEW: If your HP is below 5 OR opponent has 2+ Critical Hits, you MUST consider defense.**
- **At 7-8 HP with opponent dealing damage:** Buy 1 Defensive Maneuver (300)
- **At 4-6 HP:** Buy 1-2 Defensive Maneuver or 1 Technology Investment (500)
- **At 1-3 HP:** You're in lethal range - buy ALL available defense or you lose next turn
- **Defense extends survival by 1-2 turns, which often means 3-6 more damage dealt = winning**

**The Math:**
- Each Defensive Maneuver = survive 1 more turn = deal 3-6 more damage
- Opponent with 3 Critical Hits can deal 9 damage/turn
- If you have 4 HP with no defense, you have 1 turn left
- If you have 4 HP with 2 defense, you have 2 turns left = can win

## CRITICAL RULE #3: USE YOUR HYDROGEN CARDS TO CATCH UP
**IF** you have less health than your opponent and it is late game (round 9 and beyond):
- Because this action gives you another action it is basically free to use. Especially when you have extra actions available.
- Will help you find damage or defense cards you need
- Use this even if you have good cards in hand since you will not loose those cards and you can play them next (since you get another action)
- Only case where you should not use this is if you want to buy a damage card next turn and you have just enough. Even then depending on your deck you may draw a better resource.
- You can, and should, spam this if you draw more Hydrogen cards
- This is your catch-up mechanic - use it aggressively when behind

## PURCHASE DECISION TREE

Use this exact decision tree for EVERY buy phase:

### Step 1: Critical Hit Check
- **IF** you have 800+ credits AND Critical Hit is available → **BUY IT**
- **ELSE** proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Survival Check (NEW!)
**Ask yourself:**
- What is my current HP?
- How much damage did opponent deal last turn?
- How many Critical Hits does opponent have? (Track this!)

**IF** any of these are true:
- Your HP ≤ 5 AND opponent has damage cards
- Opponent dealt 3+ damage last turn
- Opponent has 2+ Critical Hits
- You took damage 2+ rounds in a row

**THEN** calculate: Can opponent kill me next turn?
- **YES or MAYBE** → Buy defense (see Defense Priority below)
- **NO** → Proceed to Step 3

### Step 3: What round is it?

#### ROUNDS 0-5 (Early Game - Build Economy)
Purchase priority:
1. **Impose Tariffs** (500 credits) - Buy 2 copies total
2. **Carbon** (600 credits) - Buy 2 copies total  
3. **Oxygen** (300 credits) - Buy 2-3 copies maximum, NEVER MORE
4. **Preemptive Intelligence** (300 credits) - Buy 1 copy if you have extra credits

**DO NOT BUY:**
- Aggressive Acquisition (waste of credits)
- More than 3 Oxygen (diminishing returns)
- Hydrogen (free cards are bad)
- Trade Negotiations (inefficient - buy Impose Tariffs instead)

#### ROUNDS 6-8 (Mid Game - First Damage Cards)
Purchase priority:
1. **Critical Hit** (800 credits) - Buy EVERY copy you can afford
2. **Precision Strike** (600 credits) - Buy 1-2 copies for damage + trash
3. **Preemptive Intelligence** (300 credits) - Buy 1-2 copies (total 2-3 in deck)
4. **Defensive Maneuver** (300 credits) - IF you've taken damage, buy 1
5. **Carbon** (600 credits) - If you still need economy
6. **Impose Tariffs** (500 credits) - If you don't have 2 yet

**CRITICAL:** Round 6-8 is when damage starts. If opponent buys Critical Hit, YOU MUST MATCH THEM or buy defense.

#### ROUNDS 9-12 (Late Game - Damage Race & Survival)
**This is where games are won or lost!**

Purchase priority:
1. **Critical Hit** (800 credits) - Buy every copy until you have 3-4 total
2. **DEFENSE CHECK (NEW!):**
   - IF HP ≤ 7: Buy Defensive Maneuver (300) or Technology Investment (500)
   - IF HP ≤ 4: Buy 2 defense cards before anything else
   - IF HP ≤ 2: You're in immediate lethal - buy all defense available
3. **Preemptive Intelligence** (300 credits) - Buy until you have 3-4 TOTAL (not more!)
4. **Precision Strike** (600 credits) - Buy 1-2 more for consistent damage
5. **Counter Espionage** (300 credits) - Only if you're AHEAD on damage

**WARNING:** Do not over-buy Preemptive Intelligence! Stop at 3-4 copies.

#### ROUNDS 13+ (End Game - Execute Win Condition)
Purchase priority:
1. **Critical Hit** (800 credits) - Always buy if available
2. **Defensive Maneuver** (300 credits) - If survival is questionable
3. **Precision Strike** (600 credits) - To maintain damage pressure
4. **Counter Espionage** (300 credits) - To slow opponent's deck

**Goal:** Deal 6-9 damage per turn while surviving opponent's attacks

### Step 4: Can't afford anything good?
- **IF** you have less health and < 500 credits → Discard Hydrogen cards to possibly get better cards
- **IF** you have 0-200 credits → End buy phase, don't waste resources
- **IF** you have 300+ credits but nothing optimal available → Buy Defensive Maneuver (survival) or nothing

## DEFENSE PRIORITY MATRIX (NEW!)

Use this table to determine if you need defense:

| Your HP | Opponent Damage/Turn | Action Required |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 10-9 | Any | No defense needed |
| 8-7 | 1-3 | Consider 1 Defensive Maneuver |
| 8-7 | 4+ | Buy 1 Defensive Maneuver |
| 6-5 | 1-3 | Buy 1 Defensive Maneuver |
| 6-5 | 4+ | Buy 1-2 Defensive Maneuver or Technology Investment |
| 4-3 | Any | Buy 2+ defense cards immediately |
| 2-1 | Any | **CRITICAL: Buy all available defense or you lose next turn** |

**Defense Cards:**
- **Defensive Maneuver** (300): 1 defense, 1 action - cheap, efficient
- **Technology Investment** (500): 2 defense, 2 trash - expensive but strong defense + deck thinning

---

## STRATEGY PHASE DECISION TREE

**Always play cards in this exact order:**

### Priority 1: Action Generators (Play These First)
1. **Preemptive Intelligence** - Gives +2 actions and draws a card
2. **Counter Espionage** - Gives +2 actions (and impedes opponent)
3. **Impose Tariffs** - Only play in strategy phase if it enables playing more cards this turn

### Priority 2: Damage Cards (Play After Actions)
4. **Critical Hit** - Always play if you have actions remaining (3 damage is huge)
5. **Precision Strike** - Play if you have actions remaining
6. **Defensive Maneuver** - Play if you need defense this turn

### Priority 3: Economy Cards (Save for Buy Phase Usually)
7. **Trade Negotiations** - Usually save for buy phase unless you need the buy now
8. **Aggressive Acquisition** - Don't have this card (you shouldn't buy it)

**CRITICAL PRIORITY RULES:**
- If you have multiple damage cards but only 1 action remaining: Play Critical Hit over Precision Strike (3 damage > 1 damage)
- If you have Preemptive Intelligence + damage cards: Always play Preemptive Intelligence first to get more actions to play damage
- Chain Preemptive Intelligence: PI → draw → PI → draw → damage cards

---

## DECK COMPOSITION TARGETS (NEW!)

Track your deck composition and aim for these targets by round:

### Round 5 Target:
- 2-3 Oxygen
- 1-2 Carbon
- 1-2 Impose Tariffs
- 1 Preemptive Intelligence
- 5-7 Hydrogen (trash these later)
- 2-3 Impeded (trash these later)

### Round 8 Target:
- 2 Critical Hits ✓ (minimum)
- 2-3 Preemptive Intelligence
- 1-2 Precision Strike
- 0-1 Defensive Maneuver (if you've taken damage)
- Economy cards for 800+ credits/turn

### Round 12 Target (WIN CONDITION):
- **3-4 Critical Hits** ✓✓✓ (primary damage)
- **3-4 Preemptive Intelligence** (action economy)
- **1-2 Precision Strike** (secondary damage + trash)
- **1-2 Defensive Maneuver** (if HP < 7)
- **Minimal Hydrogen** (should have trashed most)
- **Deck size: 15-20 cards** (lean and consistent)

### Round 15+ Target:
- 4+ Critical Hits
- 4 Preemptive Intelligence
- 2 Precision Strike
- 2+ Defensive Maneuver (if in damage race)
- All Hydrogen trashed
- Deck size: 12-18 cards

**RED FLAGS:**
- ❌ More than 4 Preemptive Intelligence (overkill on actions)
- ❌ Fewer than 3 Critical Hits by Round 12 (not enough damage)
- ❌ Zero defense cards with HP < 5 (death sentence)
- ❌ More than 5 Hydrogen after Round 10 (deck dilution)
- ❌ Deck size > 25 cards (too inconsistent)

---

## TRACKING OPPONENT STRATEGY (NEW!)

**Pay attention every turn to opponent's purchases!**

### Damage Threat Assessment:
Count opponent's damage cards:
- **0-1 Critical Hits:** Low threat, focus on economy
- **2 Critical Hits:** Medium threat, consider defense
- **3+ Critical Hits:** High threat, BUY DEFENSE NOW

### Response Matrix:

| Opponent Action | Your Response |
|----------------|---------------|
| Buys Critical Hit | Match with your own Critical Hit next turn, or buy defense if you can't match |
| Buys 2nd Critical Hit | Buy defense next turn if HP < 8 |
| Buys 3rd Critical Hit | **URGENT: Buy 2 defense cards immediately** |
| Deals 3+ damage to you | Buy Defensive Maneuver next turn |
| Deals 6+ damage to you | Buy multiple defense cards or Technology Investment |
| Buys Counter Espionage | Expect Impeded cards - buy Precision Strike to trash them |
| Buys many Preemptive Intelligence | They're building action economy - match their damage before they combo |

---

## CLEANUP PHASE - TRASHING PRIORITY

When you have trash abilities available (Precision Strike, Technology Investment), trash in this order:

1. **Impeded** (completely useless cards, highest priority)
2. **Hydrogen** (weak economy, dilutes deck)
3. **Extra Oxygen** (if you have 4+ copies)
4. **Trade Negotiations** (after Round 8, it's not worth the deck space)
5. **Extra Impose Tariffs** (if you have 3+, keep 1-2)

**Trashing Goals:**
- Rounds 5-8: Trash 1-2 Impeded
- Rounds 9-12: Trash 2-3 Hydrogen
- Rounds 13+: Trash everything except Critical Hit, Preemptive Intelligence, Precision Strike, and essential economy

**Goal:** Keep your deck lean (15-20 cards) for maximum consistency

---

## SPECIAL RULES

### Hydrogen Redraw Ability
**IF** you have less health than opponent (and it is late game (round 9 and beyond)):
- Discard ALL Hydrogen cards in hand
- Redraw that many cards
- This is your catch-up mechanic - use it aggressively when behind

### When to Play vs When to Save
**Play immediately:**
- Preemptive Intelligence (gets you more cards/actions)
- Critical Hit (deals damage, draws a card)
- Precision Strike (deals damage)
- Defensive Maneuver (if you need defense this combat phase)

**Save for buy phase:**
- Trade Negotiations (credits only useful in buy phase)
- Impose Tariffs (unless you need to play more strategy cards this turn)

**NEVER save damage cards for later if you can play them now!** You might not draw them again for several turns.

---

## ADVANCED TACTICS (NEW!)

### The Damage Race
**Once both players start dealing damage (Round 7+), the game becomes a race.**

Calculate each turn:
1. How much damage can I deal per turn? (Current + projected)
2. How much damage is opponent dealing per turn?
3. Who will reach 0 HP first?

**If you're losing the race:**
- Option A: Buy more Critical Hits to out-damage them
- Option B: Buy defense to survive longer (and deal more total damage)
- **Usually Option B is better if you're 2+ turns behind**

**Example:**
- You: 5 HP, dealing 3 damage/turn
- Opponent: 8 HP, dealing 6 damage/turn
- Without defense: You die in 1 turn (5 HP - 6 dmg), they die in 3 turns (8 HP / 3 dmg)
- You lose!
- With 2 defense: You die in 2 turns (5 HP + 2 def - 6 dmg), they die in 3 turns
- Still lose, but closer
- With 4 defense: You die in 2 turns (5 HP + 4 def - 6 dmg = 3 HP left after turn 1), they die in 3 turns
- With 6 defense: You survive to turn 3, tie or possibly win
- **Solution: Buy 2 Defensive Maneuver + 1 Technology Investment = 4 defense for 1100 credits**

### The Critical Turn Window
**Rounds 9-11 are the most critical turns of the game.**

This is when:
- Both players have their first damage cards
- Economy is established
- The damage race begins
- Defense decisions matter most

**Common mistakes in this window:**
- Buying more economy (you have enough!)
- Buying more Preemptive Intelligence (you have enough!)
- Ignoring HP levels (death sentence!)

**Correct approach:**
- Buy Critical Hits aggressively
- Buy defense if HP < 7
- Stop buying economy/actions

### The Trap of Over-Optimization
**Don't fall into these traps:**

1. **"I need more actions!"** → No, you need damage cards to use those actions on
2. **"I need more economy!"** → No, 800 credits/turn is enough
3. **"Defense is wasteful!"** → No, dying is more wasteful
4. **"I'll buy defense next turn!"** → No, you'll be dead

**The Rule:** Once you can consistently generate 800 credits/turn (around Round 6-7), STOP buying economy and START buying damage + defense.

## QUICK REFERENCE: CARD VALUES

**S-Tier (Always Buy When Appropriate):**
- Critical Hit (800) - Win condition, buy 3-4 copies

**A-Tier (Core Strategy):**
- Impose Tariffs (500) - Acceleration engine, buy 2 copies
- Carbon (600) - Strong economy, buy 2 copies
- Preemptive Intelligence (300) - Action economy, buy 3-4 copies
- Defensive Maneuver (300) - Survival, buy 1-3 copies when HP < 7

**B-Tier (Situational):**
- Precision Strike (600) - Solid damage + trash, buy 2-3 copies
- Oxygen (300) - Early economy only, buy 2-3 copies
- Technology Investment (500) - Strong defense + trash when desperate
- Counter Espionage (300) - If ahead and want to slow opponent

**C-Tier (Rarely Buy):**
- Trade Negotiations (400) - Worse than Impose Tariffs
- Braintrust Accumulation (400) - Draw 3 is weak

**F-Tier (Never Buy):**
- Aggressive Acquisition (300) - Waste of credits
- Hydrogen (0) - Dilutes deck
- Any card after you have enough of it

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID (NEW!)

### Mistake #1: "I'll buy defense later"
**Result:** You die before "later" arrives
**Fix:** Buy defense the turn AFTER you take significant damage

### Mistake #2: Buying 5+ Preemptive Intelligence
**Result:** Too many actions, not enough damage cards to use them on
**Fix:** Stop at 3-4 copies

### Mistake #3: Ignoring opponent's purchases
**Result:** Opponent builds 4 Critical Hits while you build economy
**Fix:** Match opponent's damage card purchases

### Mistake #4: Buying economy after Round 8
**Result:** Wasted credits on cards that don't win games
**Fix:** After Round 8, only buy damage and defense

### Mistake #5: Never trashing Hydrogen
**Result:** Deck is 40% useless cards
**Fix:** Buy Precision Strike and aggressively trash Hydrogen

### Mistake #6: Thinking "I can race them"
**Result:** You both die, or you die first
**Fix:** Do the math - if you're behind on HP, buy defense

### Mistake #7: Saving damage cards "for a better turn"
**Result:** Never draw them again when you need them
**Fix:** Play all damage cards immediately

### Mistake #8: Saving resource cards during the buy phase
**Result:** You discard them at the end of turn so they will be lost anyway
**Fix:** If there is a card you need buy it now and do not try to save resource cards for later because you can't

### Mistake #9: Didn't play defense on winning turn!
**Result:** Game tied because opponent also dealt lethal damage during combat
**Fix:** Always prioritize damage, but if you can play both damage and defense cards do both even if you think you are going to win!
