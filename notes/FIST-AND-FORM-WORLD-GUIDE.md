# Fist & Form - World Guide

## Setting Overview

**Fist & Form** takes place in a modern fantasy world where ancient martial arts traditions coexist with cutting-edge technology, corporate entertainment, and supernatural abilities. This world is similar to our own but not bound by real-world geography or history.

The defining event of the modern era was **The Fracture** - a dimensional rift that occurred 75-100 years ago, bringing non-human beings from other dimensions into what was previously a human-only world.

## The Fracture

### The Event

75-100 years ago, dimensional rifts tore open at multiple locations around the world. These weren't a single catastrophic event, but rather several smaller ruptures occurring across different regions - some nearly simultaneous, others spread over months or even years. Each rift brought different beings from various dimensions: anthropomorphic animals from one, reptilian humanoids from another, spirit-touched entities from yet another realm.

The rifts caused severe environmental damage to the areas where they manifested. The land around these sites was twisted, scarred, or fundamentally altered by dimensional energy. These "Fracture Zones" remain visibly marked to this day - areas of strange geography, unusual weather patterns, lingering dimensional resonance, or ecosystems that never fully recovered.

### The Multiple Rifts

**Why Multiple Sites:**
- Different dimensional barriers were weak in different locations
- Various species came through different rifts
- Each rift had unique characteristics and effects
- Some regions experienced multiple small rifts

**Rift Characteristics:**
- Size varied from small tears to massive ruptures
- Duration ranged from moments to weeks
- Environmental damage proportional to rift size and duration
- Each left distinct "signature" in the local area

**Notable Fracture Zones:**
- Urban centers where rifts tore through city districts
- Mountain regions with altered geology
- Coastal areas with strange tidal phenomena
- Forest regions where flora never recovered or grew twisted
- Desert zones with dimensional echoes

### Environmental Impact

**Immediate Damage (Year 0-5):**
- Destruction of buildings and infrastructure at rift sites
- Displacement of local populations
- Ecological devastation in surrounding areas
- Dangerous dimensional energy surges
- Unstable reality near rift centers

**Long-Term Scars (Ongoing):**
- Fracture Zones remain visibly different
- Some areas declared uninhabitable or restricted
- Strange weather patterns persist
- Unusual plant and animal mutations near old rift sites
- Dimensional energy can still be detected/felt
- Some zones have become spiritual pilgrimage sites
- Others are avoided or abandoned

**Current Status:**
- Environmental recovery varies by location
- Some Fracture Zones have been reclaimed and rebuilt
- Others remain dangerous or mysterious
- Valuable real estate lost, affecting local economies
- Some species feel drawn to certain Fracture Zones

### The Timeline

**Immediate Aftermath (Year 0-10):**
- Chaos and confusion as non-humans appeared across the world
- Initial conflicts and fear
- Gradual realization that newcomers were refugees, not invaders
- Humanitarian crisis as non-humans sought shelter and integration

**Integration Period (Year 10-50):**
- Laws and policies established for non-human residents
- Cultural clashes and negotiations
- First generation of non-humans learning human martial arts
- Human martial artists learning techniques from other dimensions
- Rise of integration movements and resistance groups

**Modern Era (Year 50-100):**
- Non-humans are legally integrated but remain socially marginalized
- Second and third generation non-humans who grew up in this world
- Blended martial arts traditions combining techniques from multiple dimensions
- Old prejudices linger as cultural attitudes rather than explicit discrimination
- Non-humans exist on the "fringe" - visible but not fully accepted

### Generational Perspectives

**Great-Grandparents (80-100+ years):**
- Among humans: Barely remember the Fracture, if at all
- Among long-lived species: May have experienced the Fracture as adults

**Grandparents (60-80 years):**
- Grew up during the immediate aftermath
- Remember the integration struggles firsthand
- Hold various attitudes from acceptance to prejudice

**Parents (30-50 years):**
- First "normal" generation that saw things improve
- Navigate between old prejudices and new acceptance

**Current Fighters (18-30 years):**
- Never knew a world without non-humans
- Take diversity for granted in some ways
- Still face subtle discrimination and stereotyping

### Current Status

**The Rifts Themselves:**
- Most appear to have sealed naturally over time
- A few may still be dormant or occasionally active
- Heavily monitored and studied by authorities and The Awakened
- Access to Fracture Zones varies (some restricted, some open)
- Debate over whether new rifts could open

**What Came Through:**
- Primarily sentient beings seeking refuge or fleeing catastrophe
- Different species from different rifts/dimensions
- Some unusual materials and artifacts unique to each rift
- Dimensional energy that permanently altered local environments
- The full scope and variety remains mysterious

**Ongoing Concerns:**
- Could the rifts reopen?
- Are there more dimensions that could tear through?
- What caused the simultaneous/clustered occurrence?
- Environmental remediation efforts continue
- Some believe small crossings still occasionally occur

## Non-Human Species

### Overview

Non-human species in this world are diverse but remain a minority (roughly 15-25% of the total population). They are integrated into society but still exist on the margins - visible, present, but often "othered."

## Non-Human Species

### Overview

When the dimensional rifts opened 75-100 years ago, three major species came through, each from different dimensions. While other beings may have crossed over in smaller numbers, these three represent the vast majority of non-human populations. They now comprise roughly 15-25% of the total population, with humans remaining the majority.

Each species is fundamentally different from humans and from each other, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for integration into society.

### Lifespan Diversity

One of the most significant differences between species is lifespan variance, which profoundly affects their culture, perspective, and approach to martial arts.

### The Three Major Species

---

## Grankiki

### Physical Description
Small insectoid creatures standing approximately 4 feet tall with distinctive chameleon-like heads, including independently-moving eyes that can look in different directions simultaneously. Their bodies show chitinous features mixed with more flexible segments, giving them surprising mobility despite their compact frame.

### Lifespan & Development
**20-25 years total** - Among the shortest-lived sentient species
- Childhood: 2-3 years
- Adulthood: 15-20 years
- Mature very quickly, must learn fast

### Cultural Characteristics
**Highly pack-oriented** - Individual identity is deeply tied to community
- Rarely seen alone; discomfort when separated from their group
- Multi-generational families exist simultaneously (great-grandparents, grandparents, parents, children all alive)
- Collective decision-making and shared resources
- Strong loyalty to their pack/clan
- "Goblin-like" in their communal, industrious nature

### Social Dynamics
- Often misunderstood as "childlike" due to size and pack behavior
- Stereotyped as thieves or scavengers
- Actually possess complex social structures and rich culture
- Those eyes make them excellent observers and fighters with unusual spatial awareness
- Rapid generational turnover means quick cultural adaptation

### Integration Status
- Large communities in urban centers, especially Neon Dragons territory
- Their pack mentality meshes well with gang structure
- Often work in groups: family businesses, labor crews, fighting teams
- Face prejudice based on appearance and stereotypes
- Quick lifespans mean multiple generations have grown up in this world

### Martial Arts Approach
- Must master techniques quickly given short lifespan
- Pack fighting tactics - coordinated group strategies
- Use of surprising angles and spatial awareness (those eyes!)
- Legacy and teaching are paramount - constant training of younger generations
- Intense, focused dedication - no time to waste

## The Unmoored (Slur: "Shadys")

### Physical Description
Nearly impossible to describe with precision. When in the presence of an Unmoored, you know they are there - you can sense their location, their presence, their attention - but visual details slip away like trying to remember a dream. They appear as something between a shadow, a blur, a distortion in space, or a figure seen in peripheral vision that vanishes when looked at directly.

Their exact position in space is difficult to determine, making them extremely challenging to fight or even interact with in physical ways.

### The Curse
The Unmoored claim that long ago, something catastrophic happened to their entire species - an event they refer to obliquely but never fully explain. This event "unmoored" them from reality in some fundamental way, leaving them in their current state. Whether this happened in their home dimension or during the crossing is unclear.

### Communication
The Unmoored communicate through what can only be described as **vibes** - direct transmission of intent, emotion, and meaning without words, images, or sound. This method is:
- Extremely precise with virtually no miscommunication between Unmoored
- Deeply uncomfortable for many humans and other species
- Feels invasive or unsettling to those not accustomed to it
- Creates significant barriers to integration

### Lifespan
Unknown. The Unmoored don't age in ways that can be observed, and they rarely discuss it. Some claim to remember events from before the Fracture, others seem young and inexperienced. The nature of their existence makes this question perhaps unanswerable.

### Social Dynamics
- Extremely rare to see in public spaces
- Keep to themselves, form small communities
- Most other species find them deeply unsettling
- "Shadys" used as a slur, implying something sinister or untrustworthy
- Face the most prejudice and fear of any species
- Many believe they can read minds or see secrets (mostly unfounded)
- Actually very peaceful, but their nature creates constant suspicion

### Integration Status
- Least integrated of the three major species
- Often restricted from certain public spaces
- Employment challenges - hard to work with others who can't perceive you properly
- Some find purpose in roles where their nature is an advantage
- Create their own communities, rarely mix with other species

### Martial Arts Approach
- Nearly impossible to hit or defend against effectively
- Their unclear position in space is both advantage and challenge
- Must learn to navigate a physical world they're not fully part of
- Vibe communication allows for incredible coordination with other Unmoored
- Few teachers willing to train them; often self-taught or learn from each other

## Bouaux

### Physical Description
Long-necked, bird-like creatures with two distinct life phases:

**Phase One - "The Gliding Years" (0-100 years):**
- Roughly human-sized (5-7 feet tall)
- Graceful, bird-like features with elongated neck
- Capable of gliding (not true flight) using wing-like limbs
- Lightweight bone structure
- Vibrant plumage in various colors

**Phase Two - "The Settled Years" (100-400+ years):**
- Undergo dramatic metamorphosis around age 100
- Grow significantly larger, resembling a brontosaurus in size and build
- Lose ability to glide; wings become vestigial
- Neck extends dramatically
- Must find a large dwelling (cave, warehouse, custom structure) where they will spend the rest of their life

### Lifespan & Development
**300-400+ years** - The longest-lived species
- Phase One: 0-100 years (mobile, active, learning)
- Metamorphosis: Several months of transformation
- Phase Two: 200-300+ years (stationary, teaching, contemplating)
- Oldest known Bouaux is approximately 400 years old

### Cultural Characteristics
- Deep respect for age and experience
- Phase One: Explorers, students, warriors, travelers
- Phase Two: Teachers, philosophers, historians, living libraries
- Their perspective spans centuries; patient to an extreme
- Value long-term thinking and legacy
- Create intricate multi-generational plans

### Social Dynamics
- Pre-metamorphosis Bouaux integrate fairly well
- Post-metamorphosis Bouaux become landmarks, monuments, living institutions
- "Visit the Old One in the Western Cave" - seeking wisdom from settled Bouaux
- Seen as wise but sometimes too detached from immediate concerns
- Their transformation is both celebrated and mourned (end of mobility)

### Integration Status
- Phase One Bouaux live relatively normal lives in cities
- Phase Two Bouaux require special accommodations
- Some settled Bouaux have become important community figures
- Their longevity means some remember the Fracture firsthand
- Serve as historians and witnesses to the entire integration period
- Generally respected, though their alien appearance can be off-putting

### Martial Arts Approach
**Phase One:**
- Learn techniques knowing they have a century to master them
- Incorporate gliding into combat for unique aerial approaches
- Patient, methodical training
- Often seek multiple masters over their long learning period

**Phase Two:**
- Can no longer practice martial arts physically
- Become master teachers and strategists
- Some of the greatest martial arts philosophers are settled Bouaux
- Students travel to learn from them
- Their combat experience combined with centuries of reflection creates unparalleled wisdom
