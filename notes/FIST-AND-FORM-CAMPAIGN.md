# Fist & Form - Campaign Mode Design Document

## Overview
Solo campaign mode where players travel to different locations, challenge trainers, learn new techniques, and navigate faction politics.

## Core Campaign Mechanics

### Collection System
- Players have a **Collection** of all techniques they've learned throughout the campaign
- Before each fight, players select up to **7 technique types** from their Collection to be their **Available Techniques** for that fight
- Resource cards (Focus, Momentum, Mastery) are always available to channel
- All other mechanics follow the base game rules

### Progression

**Leveling and XP:**
- Players progress through 5 levels during the campaign
- XP is earned by defeating champions:
  - Tier 1 (Novice, 10 stamina): 1 XP
  - Tier 2 (Adept, 15 stamina): 2 XP
  - Tier 3 (Master, 20 stamina): 3 XP
  - Tier 4 (Legendary, 25 stamina): 5 XP
- XP is also earned from completing background milestone quests (double the equivalent champion tier)
- Level requirements:
  - Level 1 → 2: 8 XP
  - Level 2 → 3: 18 XP total (10 more)
  - Level 3 → 4: 32 XP total (14 more)
  - Level 4 → 5: 50 XP total (18 more)
- Levels trigger background story milestones and grant stamina increases

**Stamina Increases by Species:**
- **Human**: +1 stamina at levels 2, 3, 4 (7→8→9→10→10)
- **Grankiki**: +1 stamina at levels 2, 4 (5→6→6→7→7)
- **Unmoored**: +1 stamina at levels 2, 3, 4 (6→7→8→9→9)
- **Bouaux**: +2 stamina at levels 2, 3, 4 (10→12→14→16→16)

**Money and Economy:**
- Players earn credits by defeating champions:
  - Tier 1 (Novice): 50 credits
  - Tier 2 (Adept): 100 credits
  - Tier 3 (Master): 150 credits
  - Tier 4 (Legendary): 250 credits
- **Titan Entertainment Faction Bonus**: At +4 standing with Titan Entertainment, earn +50% credits from all fights (rounded up)
  - With bonus: Tier 1 = 75, Tier 2 = 150, Tier 3 = 225, Tier 4 = 375 credits

**Trainers and Purchasing Techniques:**
- Each location has a **Trainer** NPC who sells techniques for credits
- Trainers are separate from Champions (you don't fight trainers, you pay them)
- Each trainer sells a selection of techniques:
  - 2-3 General Techniques (distributed across locations, some overlap)
  - Their location's faction techniques (if player meets standing requirements)
- **Technique Prices**:
  - General Techniques (3-4 spirit cost): 200 credits
  - Faction Mid-Tier (4-5 spirit cost): 300 credits
  - Faction Game Changers (6-8 spirit cost): 400-500 credits
- See "Learning Techniques" section below for full details

**Campaign Structure:**
- Players start with only basic starter techniques
- Defeat champions at various locations to unlock new techniques and earn XP and credits
- Each location is associated with a faction and offers faction-specific techniques
- Player choices affect faction standing (pleased/angered)
- Faction standing unlocks rewards or creates consequences
- Level 5 triggers the campaign finale

## Player Backgrounds

At the start of a campaign, players choose a background that defines their character's narrative journey. Backgrounds are purely narrative-focused and do not provide mechanical bonuses. Each background is built around an ideal that overlaps with two factions, creating natural story tension and meaningful choices throughout the campaign.

### Background Structure

Each background includes:
- **Core Ideal**: The central theme/value the character represents
- **Concept**: Who the character is and what drives them
- **Faction Tension**: The two factions their ideal connects to and the choice they face
- **Three Story Milestones**: Major narrative beats that occur at specific campaign progress points

### The Six Backgrounds

---

### 1. The Oath-Keeper (Masters' Circle + Neon Dragons)

**Ideal**: Honor through Loyalty

**Concept**: You swore a sacred oath (to protect someone, avenge a wrong, or uphold a principle) but were forced to break it. Now you must rebuild your honor.

**Tension**: Traditional honor vs pragmatic loyalty - sometimes keeping your word means breaking it

**Milestone 1** (Upon reaching Level 2):
- **"The Reminder"** - Someone from your past appears and reminds you of the oath you broke. They demand you make amends.
- **Choice**: Commit to honoring traditional codes (Masters' Circle +1) OR acknowledge that survival required breaking it (Neon Dragons +1)

**Milestone 2** (Upon reaching Level 3):
- **"The Test"** - The person/principle you swore to protect is threatened again. You must choose how to act.
- **Quest Unlocked**: Face a champion while following a restriction related to your original oath

**Milestone 3** (Upon reaching Level 4):
- **"The Reckoning"** - Final confrontation with the consequences of your broken oath.
- **Major Choice**: 
  - Fully embrace traditional honor (Masters' Circle +2, Neon Dragons -2)
  - Fully embrace street loyalty (Neon Dragons +2, Masters' Circle -2)
  - Find balance - both matter in different contexts (Both factions +1)

---

### 2. The Legacy Bearer (Masters' Circle + Titan Entertainment)

**Ideal**: Glory through Redemption

**Concept**: Your family was once legendary but fell from grace (scandal, defeat, betrayal). You fight to restore their name - or forge a new one.

**Tension**: Redeem family honor through tradition vs escape their shadow through fame

**Milestone 1** (Upon reaching Level 2):
- **"The Shadow"** - Someone recognizes your family name and either mocks you or expresses pity. The past haunts you.
- **Choice**: Defend your family's honor (Masters' Circle +1) OR declare you'll surpass them (Titan Entertainment +1)

**Milestone 2** (Upon reaching Level 3):
- **"The Offer"** - Titan Entertainment wants to exploit your family story for ratings. Masters' Circle offers to help restore your name through traditional means.
- **Major Choice**: Take the Titan deal, take the Masters' offer, or reject both

**Milestone 3** (Upon reaching Level 4):
- **"The Legacy Defined"** - Face the person/event that disgraced your family (or a symbolic representative).
- **Quest Unlocked**: Epic confrontation that determines how your story is remembered

---

### 3. The Seeker (Masters' Circle + The Awakened)

**Ideal**: Wisdom through Discipline

**Concept**: You seek perfection - but is it found in traditional forms or spiritual transcendence?

**Tension**: Mastery of technique vs mastery of self - which path leads to truth?

**Milestone 1** (Upon reaching Level 2):
- **"The Question"** - Both a traditional master and a spiritual guide offer to teach you their path to perfection.
- **Choice**: Follow traditional mastery (Masters' Circle +1), follow spiritual transcendence (The Awakened +1), or try to learn from both (unlock special dual-path quest)

**Milestone 2** (Upon reaching Level 3):
- **"The Contradiction"** - Your chosen path reveals a flaw or limitation. Doubt creeps in.
- **Quest Unlocked**: Must win a fight using ONLY techniques from the faction you've been neglecting

**Milestone 3** (Upon reaching Level 4):
- **"The Answer"** - You face a challenge that tests your philosophy.
- **Major Choice**:
  - Technique is perfection (Masters' Circle +2, The Awakened -1)
  - Spirit is perfection (The Awakened +2, Masters' Circle -1)
  - Both paths lead to the same truth (Both factions +1, unlock unique ending)

---

### 4. The Ambitious Outsider (Neon Dragons + Titan Entertainment)

**Ideal**: Power through Determination

**Concept**: Born with nothing, you'll do whatever it takes to reach the top.

**Tension**: Street power vs corporate power - which ladder do you climb?

**Milestone 1** (Upon reaching Level 2):
- **"The Opportunity"** - Both Neon Dragons and Titan Entertainment notice your talent and offer you a path up.
- **Choice**: Join the crew (Neon Dragons +1) or sign the contract (Titan Entertainment +1)

**Milestone 2** (Upon reaching Level 3):
- **"The Price"** - Your chosen path demands something that compromises the other.
- **Major Choice**: Honor your commitment or betray for greater opportunity

**Milestone 3** (Upon reaching Level 4):
- **"The Summit"** - You've reached the top of your chosen ladder. But is it enough?
- **Major Choice**:
  - Consolidate power in your faction (Chosen faction +2)
  - Leverage position to control both factions (Both factions +1, unlock dangerous ending)
  - Reject it all - power corrupted you (Both factions -2, unlock redemption ending)

---

### 5. The Exile (Neon Dragons + The Awakened)

**Ideal**: Freedom through Rejection

**Concept**: You were cast out or walked away. Now you forge your own path.

**Tension**: Freedom through rebellion vs freedom through enlightenment - what does liberation mean?

**Milestone 1** (Upon reaching Level 2):
- **"The Past Calls"** - Someone from the place/group that exiled you tracks you down.
- **Revelation**: Learn why you were really cast out (or why you really left)
- **Choice**: Embrace your exile as freedom (The Awakened +1) or plot revenge/return (Neon Dragons +1)

**Milestone 2** (Upon reaching Level 3):
- **"The Invitation"** - You're offered a chance to return/reconcile with your past.
- **Major Choice**: Return on their terms, return on YOUR terms (fight for it), or refuse

**Milestone 3** (Upon reaching Level 4):
- **"The Truth"** - Final confrontation with the source of your exile.
- **Quest Unlocked**: Face the person/institution that cast you out
- **Multiple Endings**: Violent liberation, peaceful transcendence, or forgiveness

---

### 6. The Mystic Performer (Titan Entertainment + The Awakened)

**Ideal**: Transcendence through Expression

**Concept**: You believe combat is art, performance, and spiritual practice all at once.

**Tension**: Entertaining crowds vs achieving enlightenment - can spectacle be sacred?

**Milestone 1** (Upon reaching Level 2):
- **"The Critic"** - Someone challenges your philosophy: "Is your 'art' just shallow spectacle? Is your 'spirituality' just performance?"
- **Choice**: Prove spectacle has meaning (Titan Entertainment +1), prove combat is sacred (The Awakened +1), or prove they're inseparable (unlock special quest)

**Milestone 2** (Upon reaching Level 3):
- **"The Choice"** - A crucial moment where entertainment and enlightenment conflict.
- **Major Choice**: Compromise one ideal for the other or find synthesis

**Milestone 3** (Upon reaching Level 4):
- **"The Masterpiece"** - Create your ultimate expression - fight as art, art as spirituality.
- **Quest Unlocked**: Special exhibition match with unique victory conditions (must win beautifully AND spiritually)

---

### Design Notes

**Milestone Triggers:**
- All backgrounds trigger milestones at Levels 2, 3, and 4
- Level 5 triggers the campaign finale for all backgrounds
- Ensures consistent pacing across all playstyles
- Players experience all three milestones before the ending

**Integration with Faction Standing:**
- Backgrounds naturally guide players toward their two affiliated factions
- Choices allow rebellion against expected path
- Background story beats are separate from but complement faction standing quests

---

---

## Species Selection

At the start of a campaign, players choose which species they are playing. This affects their starting stamina and may provide special rules. All other campaign rules remain the same (starting deck of 7 Focus + 3 Misstep, draw hand size, etc.).

### Playable Species

**Human (Normal Difficulty)**
- Starting Stamina: 7
- Special Rules: None
- Standard baseline experience

**Grankiki (Hard Difficulty)**
- Starting Stamina: 5
- Special Rules: Draw 6 cards instead of 5 at the start of each turn
- Challenge: Lower health pool but more cards to work with

**Unmoored (Challenging Difficulty)**
- Starting Stamina: 6
- Special Rules: Opponent starts each fight with 2 additional Misstep cards in their starting deck (9 Focus, 5 Misstep total)
- Challenge: Slightly lower health but opponents are hindered

**Bouaux (Easy Difficulty)**
- Starting Stamina: 10
- Special Rules: Can increase maximum stamina over time through campaign milestones (mechanic to be determined)
- Challenge: Higher starting health provides more margin for error

### Design Notes
- Species selection is for campaign mode only
- Starting deck composition remains the same for all species (7 Focus, 3 Misstep)
- Grankiki is the only species that modifies hand size
- Difficulty ratings indicate relative challenge level for experienced players

## Campaign Structure

### Location System

**Total: 9 Locations**

**The 9 Locations:**

**Faction Home Bases:**
1. **The Sanctum Peaks** - Masters' Circle home base (Mountain monastery, traditional training halls)
2. **The Undercroft** - Neon Dragons home base (Underground city, abandoned subway fight clubs)
3. **Prism Arena** - Titan Entertainment home base (Entertainment district, massive stadium complex)
4. **Fracture Valley** - The Awakened home base (Major Fracture Zone, temples studying dimensional energy)

**Naturally Contested Locations:**
5. **Apex City** - Human capital, massive metropolis (NYC vibes), financial and cultural center
6. **Chrome Bay** - Cyberpunk island (Tokyo vibes), dense urban tech district with traditional harbor
7. **The Glasslands** - Desert Fracture Zone where sand turned to glass, crystalline structures
8. **Port Meridian** - Coastal trading city, multicultural hub, neutral ground for faction meetings
9. **The Verdant Sanctum** - Ancient forest with Awakened temples, Phase Two Bouaux homes in massive trees

**Campaign Start Setup:**
- One faction's home base is randomly selected to become contested (paired with a rival faction)
- The other 3 factions keep their home bases as controlled locations
- The 5 naturally contested locations get random faction pairings from these combinations:
  1. Masters' Circle vs Neon Dragons
  2. Masters' Circle vs Titan Entertainment
  3. Masters' Circle vs The Awakened
  4. Neon Dragons vs Titan Entertainment
  5. Neon Dragons vs The Awakened
  6. Titan Entertainment vs The Awakened

**Result:**
- **3 Controlled Locations** (home bases that stayed controlled)
- **6 Contested Locations** (5 naturally contested + 1 home base that became contested)

**Contested Location Mechanics:**
- Each contested location is competed over by 2 factions
- Faction pairings are randomly assigned at campaign start (as described above)
- Defeating champions affects both factions (anger one, please the other)
- Mix of both factions' techniques available through champions

**Controlled Location Mechanics:**
- Three factions control their home base (one faction's became contested)
- Only that faction's champions and techniques available
- Deeper access to that faction's philosophy and strongest techniques
- If you're at -4 standing with a faction, you're locked out of their controlled location

### Champion Tier System

**Location Structure:**
- **Tier 1: Novice Champions**
  - stamina based on species
  - Available Techniques: 5 starting, 1 General
  - Reward: Learn 1 General Technique from their pool
  
- **Tier 2: Adept Champions** (2 champions, 1 per faction in contested locations)
  - stamina based on species +3
  - Available Techniques: Mix of Starting (2) + General (2) + Faction Mid-Tier cards (2 from their faction)
  - Reward: Learn 1 technique from their pool
  
- **Tier 3: Master Champions** (2 champions, 1 per faction)
  - stamina based on species +5
  - Available Techniques: General (3) + faction pool (3 their faction's techniques)
  - Reward: Learn 1 technique from their pool
  - Each represents one of the two factions at this location

- **Optional Tier 4: Legendary Master** (1 per home base)
  - stamina based on species +7
  - Special rules or unique abilities
  - Guards coveted techniques or provides major faction standing boost

### Learning Techniques

Players can learn techniques through two methods:

**Method 1 - Defeat Champions:**
- When you defeat a champion, choose 1 technique from their Available Techniques to add to your collection (if you don't already have it)
- This is free and happens immediately after victory
- Limited by what techniques the champion has in their deck

**Method 2 - Purchase from Trainers:**
- Pay credits to a trainer at any location to learn a technique they offer
- Each location has one trainer with their own selection of techniques
- Not limited by champion availability - can buy any technique the trainer sells (subject to faction standing requirements)

**Technique Availability:**
- **General Techniques**: Distributed across trainers at different locations, always available for purchase
- **Faction Techniques**: Only available for purchase if you have +2 or higher standing with that faction
- Trainers at faction-aligned locations sell that faction's techniques

### Faction Standing System

Players build reputation (positive or negative) with each of the four factions. Faction standing affects available rewards, story options, and potentially unlocks special techniques or challenges.

**Two Ways to Change Faction Standing:**

1. **Story Choices** (to be defined in campaign narrative)
   - Dialogue decisions
   - Quest completion methods
   - Alliances and betrayals
   - Helping or hindering faction interests

2. **Defeating Champions in Contested Locations**
   - Defeating a faction's champion **angers** that faction (-1 standing)
   - **Pleases** their rival faction at that location (+1 standing)
   - Creates strategic tension: "I want this technique, but it'll anger this faction..."
   - Only applies to Tier 2 and Tier 3 champions (faction-aligned)
   - Tier 1 champions are neutral and don't affect standing

**Standing Levels:**

Faction standing ranges from **-4 to +4** for a total of 9 levels:

- **+4: Maximum Favor** - Major rewards/benefits
