# Fist & Form - Campaign Mode Design Document

## Overview
Solo campaign mode where players travel to different locations, challenge trainers, learn new techniques, and navigate faction politics.

## Core Campaign Mechanics

### Collection System
- Players don't have a traditional deck in campaign mode
- Instead, they have a **Collection** of all techniques they've learned
- Before each fight, players select up to **7 technique types** to be their **Available Techniques** for that fight
- Resource cards (Focus, Momentum, Mastery) are always available to channel
- Fights use standard rules: start with 7 Focus cards and 3 Misstep cards, draw 5 cards, play normally

### Progression
- Players start with only basic starter techniques
- Defeat trainers at various locations to unlock new techniques
- Each location is associated with a faction and offers faction-specific techniques
- Player choices affect faction standing (pleased/angered)
- Faction standing unlocks rewards or creates consequences

## The Four Factions

### 1. The Masters' Circle
**Philosophy**: Preservation of traditional techniques, discipline, honor in combat

**Aesthetic**: Classical dojos, traditional garb mixed with modern touches, respect for lineage

**Technique Focus**: Balanced, fundamentally sound, no tricks - pure skill

**Locations**: Historic dojos, mountain retreats, traditional training halls

**What Pleases Them**: Honorable victories, respecting opponents, mastering fundamentals

**What Angers Them**: Dirty tactics, disrespecting traditions, flashy showboating

**Faction Dynamics**:
- Natural Ally: The Awakened (both value discipline and mastery)
- Natural Rival: The Neon Dragons (honor vs pragmatism), Titan Entertainment (tradition vs commercialization)

### 4. The Awakened

## Campaign Structure

### Location System

**Total: 9 Locations**

**6 Contested Locations:**
- Each location is contested by 2 factions competing for influence

  2. Masters' Circle vs Titan Entertainment
  3. Masters' Circle vs Awakened
  4. Neon Dragons vs Titan Entertainment
  5. Neon Dragons vs Awakened
  6. Titan Entertainment vs Awakened
- Defeating trainers affects both factions (anger one, please the other)
- Mix of both factions' techniques available through trainers

**3 Controlled Locations:**
- One location controlled by each of 3 factions (their "home base")
- The 4th faction is randomly left out and doesn't get a controlled location
- Only that faction's trainers and techniques available
- Deeper access to that faction's philosophy and strongest techniques

### Trainer Tier System

  - Deck: 7 Focus, 3 Misstep

### Learning Techniques

**Core Rule:** When you defeat a trainer, choose 1 technique from their Available Techniques to add to your collection (if you don't already have it).

**Faction Standing Impact (Contested Locations):**
- Defeating a faction's trainer **angers** that faction (-1 standing)
- **Pleases** their rival faction at that location (+1 standing)
- Creates strategic tension: "I want this technique, but it'll anger this faction..."

**Progression:**
- Players can move between locations freely
- Higher tier trainers within a location may require completing lower tiers first (to be determined)
- Strategic decisions about which locations to visit and which factions to align with

## Win Conditions (To Be Developed)

- Defeat a certain number of trainers?
- Reach maximum favor with a faction?
- Complete all locations?
- Defeat the legendary masters?
- Multiple endings based on choices?
