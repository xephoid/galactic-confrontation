## The Game
This is a two player strategy deck building game. Players buy action and resource cards to build a deck that can beat their opponent.

The goal of the game is to reduce your opponents base hit points to 0. The game is played over several rounds where each player takes a turn. Each round has two phases. First is the player phase where each player takes a turn. Then there is a combat resolution phase where damage is dealt.

## Setup

Separate all the different cards into individual piles so that all the cards of the same name are in their own piles. There are 10 cards of each kind. This is called the supply. Then each player builds a starting deck with 7 Hydrogen cards and 3 Impeded cards and shuffles them. Players then each draw 5 cards into their hand. Each player starts with 10 base hit points.

## Hot to Play
A player’s turn also has multiple phases. They are as follows:
1. Strategy
2. Buy
3. Cleanup

The strategy phase is where the player may play strategy cards from their hand. By default the player can play one strategy card. However, the card may allow them to increase the number of strategy cards they can play. It may also give other bonuses. Once a card is played it is placed in the player’s discard pile unless it is a damage or defense card. When playing a strategy card its effect is immediately applied and effects can stack so think carefully about the sequence of cards you will play. Some strategy cards allow you to draw more cards which can be useful to play more cards or gain more resources.

The buy phase is where the player may use resource cards to pay for additional cards from the supply. Each card has a price and the player can combine resources to add up to the price of the card. There is no change after a card is purchased. If there is a situation where the player must spend more resource cards than they need to purchase a card the extra is lost. Once a card is purchased the player may put that card in their discard pile. They also put all resource cards used for the purchase into the discard pile as well. By default the player may only purchase on card during their Buy Phase, however there are strategy cards which may increase the number of cards a player can buy. There are also strategy cards that increase the amount of resources the player has available during the Buy Phase. These resources can only be used during the subsequent buy phase that the strategy card was played. Once the Buy Phase ends the additional resources are lost if they are not spent.

The cleanup phase is at the end of the player’s turn. Some strategy cards allow the player to trash a number of cards. The player may trash cards at this time. To trash a card simply remove it from the game. At this point they will discard any cards left in their hand. Then draw a new set of 5 cards from their deck. If they are unable to draw more cards because the deck has run out they first draw the cars that are left and then they must shuffle their discard pile and this becomes their new deck where they then draw the remaining cards.

After both players have finished their turn the combat phase of the round begins. During this phase players count up damage and defense from strategy cards they played during their strategy phase. Defense cards reduce the damage an opponent has done. Both players calculate damage simultaneously and reduce their base hit points. If a player has 0 or less base hit points they have been defeated and their opponent wins! If both have been reduced to 0 or less at the same time then the game ends in a tie. If neither has been reduced to 0 all damage and defense cards are discarded and the next round begins.

## Impeded cards
Impeded cards have no use in the game. They represent setbacks the players face when trying to achieve their goals. They cannot be played or discarded during the strategy or buy phase. They can only be trashed or discarded during the cleanup phase.
