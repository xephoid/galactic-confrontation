# Revised Strategy: Complete Edition

After playing a close game that came down to a single bad draw, here's the optimized strategy with ALL lessons learned:

## Core Principles

**1. Deck Quality > Deck Quantity**
- **NEVER buy Hydrogen after setup** - it dilutes your deck
- Skip buys entirely if you can only afford Hydrogen
- A lean 12-15 card deck is infinitely better than 25+ bloated cards

**2. The Trash Priority (CRITICAL - LEARNED THE HARD WAY)**
- **Trashing Impeded is THE MOST IMPORTANT early action**
- Rush Decisive Strike (600) as your first major purchase for damage + trash
- **Trash at LEAST one Impeded per turn** once you have Decisive Strike
- A single Impeded draw in a critical moment can cost you the entire game
- Aim to have ALL Impeded cards trashed by turn 10-12
- **Enemy Impeded cards are just as deadly as your starting ones**

**3. Efficient Resource Curve (UPDATED)**
- Buy Oxygen (300) early - best efficiency ratio
- **Carbon is NOT useless** - buy 1-2 Carbon cards in late game (turns 10+) to enable Critical Hit purchases
- Stop buying resources once you have 4-5 total resource cards (Oxygen + Carbon combined)

**4. Disruption Matters (NEW)**
- Counter Intelligence is a powerful mid-game disruption tool
- Giving your opponent Impeded cards slows them down significantly
- Use disruption when ahead to maintain your lead

## Optimal Build Order

**Turns 1-3: Minimal Economy**
1. Turn 1: Buy **1 Oxygen** (300)
2. Turn 2: Buy **Aggressive Acquisition** (300) or **Trade Negotiations** (400)
3. Turn 3: Buy **Impose Tariffs** (500) or another engine card

**Turns 4-6: Engine + IMMEDIATE Trash**
4. Priority: **Decisive Strike (600)** - Start trashing Impeded IMMEDIATELY
5. Buy **Preemptive Insurgence (300)** for card draw + actions
6. Buy **one more Oxygen** only if needed

**Turns 7-10: Damage Rush + Strategic Disruption**
7. Buy **Critical Hit (800)** as soon as affordable
8. **TRASH IMPEDED EVERY TURN** - this is non-negotiable
9. **Optional: Buy Counter Intelligence (300)** if you're ahead and want to slow opponent
10. Consider buying **1 Carbon (600)** if you have 4+ Oxygen and need Critical Hit fuel
11. Buy **second Decisive Strike (600)** for more damage + trash

**Turns 11-15: Power Turns**
12. Buy **second Critical Hit (800)**
13. Consider **second Carbon (600)** if going for multiple Critical Hit turns
14. Only buy damage cards from here
15. Buy **Technology Investment (400)** ONLY if opponent is ahead on damage

**Turns 16+: Close Out**
- Your deck should have 0-1 Impeded remaining (all others trashed)
- Every turn should threaten 3-4+ damage
- Race to deal 10+ damage before opponent

## Key Combos to Execute

**The God Hand:**
- Aggressive Acquisition → Preemptive Insurgence → Impose Tariffs → draw into more strategy cards → buy 2-3 cards with 700+ credits

**The Carbon Power Play (NEW):**
- Oxygen (200) + Carbon (300) + Impose Tariffs (200) = 700 credits
- Enough to buy Critical Hit (800) with just one more Hydrogen
- Or buy two Decisive Strikes (600 each) in one turn

**The Disruption Lock (NEW):**
- Turn 7-9: Buy Counter Intelligence, give opponent 2 Impeded
- Turn 8-10: Build your damage while opponent struggles with dead draws
- Turn 11+: Your clean deck vs their clogged deck = you win

**The Killing Turn:**
- Play multiple Aggressive Acquisitions to get +3 buys
- Have 1200+ credits available (Carbon + Oxygen + engine cards)
- Buy 2 Critical Hits in one turn (or 1 Critical Hit + 2 Decisive Strikes)
- Next turn: deal 6+ damage for the kill

## Critical Gameplay Lessons

**Calculate Before You Draw:**
- Before playing card-draw effects in must-win situations, calculate your odds
- Example: 8 cards in deck, 2 are Decisive Strikes, 3 are Impeded = 25% good, 37.5% bad
- Sometimes it's better to NOT draw if odds are poor

**When to End Your Turn Early:**
- If you have enough damage to threaten lethal, don't risk drawing Impeded
- If playing more cards might clog your hand with junk, stop early
- Better to have a clean hand next turn than a bloated hand now

**Deck Composition Awareness:**
- Always know approximately how many Impeded remain (both yours and enemy-given)
- Track your damage sources (how many Decisive Strikes / Critical Hits in deck vs discard)
- Plan your lethal turn based on what's actually available, not what you hope to draw

## Strategy Card Tier List (UPDATED)

**S-Tier (Always Good):**
- **Decisive Strike (600)** - Damage + trash, the perfect card
- **Critical Hit (800)** - Massive damage + trash
- **Aggressive Acquisition (300)** - Actions + buys, enables big turns
- **Impose Tariffs (500)** - Credits + card draw + buys

**A-Tier (Strong Core Cards):**
- **Preemptive Insurgence (300)** - Actions + card draw
- **Trade Negotiations (400)** - Credits + buys
- **Oxygen (300)** - Best early economy

**B-Tier (Situational but Good):**
- **Carbon (600)** - Late-game economy for Critical Hits
- **Counter Intelligence (300)** - Mid-game disruption when ahead
- **Technology Investment (400)** - Defense + economy when behind

**C-Tier (Rarely Buy):**
- **Defensive Maneuver (300)** - Only if desperate for defense
- **Braintrust Accumulation (400)** - Card draw without actions, mediocre

**D-Tier (Almost Never Buy):**
- **Hydrogen (0)** - Dilutes deck, skip after setup

## What NOT To Do (My Fatal Mistakes)

❌ **Don't delay trashing Impeded** - they're time bombs that will explode in critical moments
❌ **Don't draw cards blindly when you need specific cards** - calculate your odds first
❌ **Don't buy free Hydrogen with extra buys** - deck bloat kills you
❌ **Don't dismiss Carbon entirely** - it has a role in late-game power turns
❌ **Don't dismiss Counter Intelligence** - disruption is powerful when timed right
❌ **Don't buy defense reactively** - by the time you need it, you're already losing
❌ **Don't leave Impeded in your deck past turn 12** - you WILL draw them at the worst moment
❌ **Don't underestimate enemy-given Impeded** - they're just as deadly as your starting ones

## Adaptive Strategy

**If Opponent Rushes Damage:**
- Buy **Counter Intelligence (300)** to slow them down with Impeded
- Buy **Technology Investment (400)** for +2 defense + economy
- Buy **one Defensive Maneuver (300)** maximum
- Counter-attack with Critical Hits faster

**If Opponent Builds Economy:**
- Rush **Decisive Strike (600)** turn 4-5
- Buy **Counter Intelligence (300)** turn 7-8 to disrupt their engine
- Get **Critical Hit (800)** by turn 7-8
- Apply pressure before they stabilize

**If You're Ahead (turns 7-10):**
- **BUY COUNTER INTELLIGENCE** - Lock them out with disruption
- Continue building damage while they struggle
- Maintain your lead by slowing their trash/economy

**If You're Behind (turns 7-10):**
- Skip Counter Intelligence - you need to catch up, not slow down
- Rush Critical Hits for maximum damage
- Race to lethal before opponent stabilizes

**If Game Goes Long (15+ turns):**
- This is where Carbon shines
- Buy 2 Carbon cards to fuel multiple Critical Hit purchases
- Your clean deck (no Impeded) will cycle efficiently
- Win through superior card quality

## The Winning Pattern

A perfect game looks like:
- **Turn 1-3:** 1-2 Oxygen, 1-2 engine cards
- **Turn 4-6:** First Decisive Strike, start trashing Impeded EVERY turn
- **Turn 7-10:** Critical Hit, Counter Intelligence (if ahead), continue aggressive trashing, consider 1 Carbon
- **Turn 11-14:** Second Critical Hit, all Impeded gone, optional second Carbon
- **Turn 15+:** Deal 3-6 damage per turn with clean deck cycling

**Target deck composition by Turn 12:**
- 3-4 Oxygen
- 1-2 Carbon (optional but powerful)
- 2-3 Aggressive Acquisition / Preemptive Insurgence
- 1-2 Impose Tariffs / Trade Negotiations
- 0-1 Counter Intelligence (if you used disruption strategy)
- 2 Critical Hit
- 2 Decisive Strike
- 0-1 remaining Hydrogen
- **0 Impeded (all trashed by turn 12)**
- **Total: ~15-16 cards**

## Counter Intelligence: Deep Dive

**When to Buy Counter Intelligence:**
✅ Turns 7-10 (prime disruption window)
✅ When you're ahead on damage/economy
✅ Before opponent has 2+ Decisive Strikes to trash Impeded easily
✅ When opponent is building a combo-heavy deck
✅ As your 3rd-4th action card (after economy is established)

**When NOT to Buy Counter Intelligence:**
❌ Turns 1-5 (you need economy first)
❌ When you're behind (you need to catch up, not slow down)
❌ When opponent already has lots of trash (they'll just remove your Impeded)
❌ Turn 11+ (too late, focus on damage)

**Counter Intelligence Math:**
- For 300 credits, you get +2 actions AND slow opponent
- Opponent must spend trash slots on YOUR Impeded instead of their bad cards
- Each Impeded you give them is ~10-15% chance to clog a critical draw
- In a close game, this disruption can be the difference between winning and losing

**Real Game Example:**
Player A bought Counter Intelligence turn 9. Those Impeded cards stayed in my deck until turn 18. One of them cost me the game by preventing a critical Decisive Strike draw. **That's a 300-credit investment that won the game!**

## The Math

With 10 HP each:
- Critical Hit deals 3 damage
- 4 Critical Hits = 12 damage = guaranteed win
- 2 Critical Hits + 2 Decisive Strikes = 8 damage (need 1 more damage source)
- Race to deal 10+ damage in 12-15 turns

**The absolute keys to victory:**
1. **TRASH IMPEDED AGGRESSIVELY** - one bad draw loses games (whether your Impeded or enemy-given)
2. **Never dilute your deck with worthless cards**
3. **Carbon has a role** - 1-2 cards in late game for Critical Hit fuel
4. **Counter Intelligence wins close games** - disruption is powerful when timed right
5. **Calculate odds before critical draws** - don't gamble when you can count cards

The player who gets 2 Critical Hits first AND maintains a lean, Impeded-free deck AND disrupts their opponent at the right time wins 95%+ of games.

## Quick Reference: Purchase Priority by Turn

**Turn 1-2:** Oxygen (300)
**Turn 3-4:** Engine cards (Aggressive Acquisition, Trade Negotiations, Impose Tariffs)
**Turn 5-6:** Decisive Strike (600) - START TRASHING
**Turn 7-8:** Critical Hit (800)
**Turn 8-10:** Counter Intelligence (300) if ahead, OR second damage card
**Turn 10-12:** Carbon (600) if going late, OR second Critical Hit
**Turn 13+:** Only damage cards (Critical Hit, Decisive Strike)

**Never forget:** Every turn after getting Decisive Strike, you should trash at least 1 card. Clean deck = consistent draws = winning games.
